## Executive Summary
The Integrated Toroidal-Syntropic Model replaces the closed ΛCDM universe with an open toroidal “jet engine” that intakes syntropy from the superfluid plenum. Dark matter and dark energy are eliminated as zero-torsion artifacts.

**Core Equation**  
a₀ = c H₀ / (2π) ≈ 1.08 × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s² (Torsional Yield Point)

**Key Applications**  
- Syntropic Power Cell (1 MW clean output)  
- 1 m Warp Buoyancy Shield (1.2 MW, \~15% mass anomaly)  
- Loom Torsional Communication (zero-latency)

**Proofs (2025–2026)**  
- Gaia DR3 wide-binary velocity excesses  
- Chang’e-6 natural high-purity SWNTs in Goldilocks EFE zone
